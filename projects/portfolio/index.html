<p>So, why coding you might ask, well, I've had a love-hate relationship with design in general. My bachelors degree was in Graphic Design, back when Dreamwaver did all the coding for you (remember that?), but things did work out and I ended up getting into teaching. More recently, a friend recommended I give it a try and since trying out some online resources figured a more structured course would suit me better.</p></main>
